<h2>Recent Experience</h2>
<h3><a href="https://aws.amazon.com">Amazon Web Services (AWS)</a> : Software Development Engineer</h3>
<p><strong>June 2017 - Present</strong></p>
<p>I am the technical lead developer in a team of 6, that develops and maintain automated ETL pipelines for big data using
tools like Scala, Spark, SQL and AWS services such as S3, Glue and Lambda. Our multiple petabyte data-lake was designed
and implemented by myself to ingest 60+TB of data a day and provide access (P100 read load of 19 million requests a
minute) for scientists and analysts to answer business questions and run simulations to test algorithm changes before
pushing them to production.</p>
<p>We have streamlined our ingestion layer to ingest data from multiple core EC2 teams, across multiple regions,
within minutes. The system I designed, and continue to oversee, has saved Amazon millions in resources and headcount
by negating the need for analytics teams to stand up and maintain their own data ingestion systems. I maintain data
security, permissions solutions and policies for enterprise scale data warehouse and data lake implementations including
data encryption and database user access controls, logging, as well as compliance controls for sharing data between teams.
I am also responsible for overseeing the development, testing, and deploying code using internal software development
tool sets. This includes the code for deploying infrastructure and solutions for secure data storage, ETL pipelines,
data catalogue, and data query.</p>
<p>Prior to this I was also a developer on other EC2 control plane teams including those responsible for launching
EC2 instances, and placing them efficiently on the underlying hardware.</p>
